#  Pseudocode Learning

**Pseudocode** is a way to describe an algorithm in plain, human-readable language without relying on the syntax of a specific programming language. It focuses on **logic and steps** rather than coding details, making it easier to plan and understand algorithms.

> Practice pseudocode step by step to improve your algorithmic thinking.

This repository is designed for **learning and practicing pseudocode**. The exercises are organized **in order**, starting from basic concepts and gradually progressing to more advanced topics. Each file contains **clear examples and explanations** to make the learning process smooth and structured.
